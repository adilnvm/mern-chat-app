Issues
1)Real-time Messaging:
Real-time messaging is currently not working due to issues with Socket.io. If anyone can help resolve the real-time message functionality, please contribute!

2)the live website may suffer functionality issues because maybe for the free version of render.com , we have to regularly manually deploy from the repo

3)User Interface:
The UI could use some improvements. Suggestions for a better design are welcome.
