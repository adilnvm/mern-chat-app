Live Website (sometimes the website may take upto 3 minutes to open as the server provider is busy, just open it in a new tab and visit after 3-4 minutes)

Issues
1)Real-time Messaging:
Real-time messaging is currently not working due to issues with Socket.io. If anyone can help resolve the real-time message functionality, please contribute!

2)the live website may suffer functionality issues because maybe for the free version of render.com , we have to regularly manually deploy from the repo

3)User Interface:
The UI could use some improvements. Suggestions for a better design are welcome.

*Ps - Some parts of the project are based on commonly shared examples and patterns found online. While I believe the material was publicly available, I cannot trace the exact original author or repository to give proper credit.*
